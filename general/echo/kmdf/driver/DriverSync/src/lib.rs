//! # Abstract
//!
//!    This driver demonstrates use of a default I/O Queue, its
//!    request start events, cancellation event, and a synchronized DPC.
//!
//!    To demonstrate asynchronous operation, the I/O requests are not completed
//!    immediately, but stored in the drivers private data structure, and a
//!    timer DPC will complete it next time the DPC runs.
//!
//!    During the time the request is waiting for the DPC to run, it is
//!    made cancellable by the call `WdfRequestMarkCancelable`. This
//!    allows the test program to cancel the request and exit instantly.
//!
//!    This rather complicated set of events is designed to demonstrate
//!    the driver frameworks synchronization of access to a device driver
//!    data structure, and a pointer which can be a proxy for device hardware
//!    registers or resources.
//!
//!    This common data structure, or resource is accessed by new request
//!    events arriving, the DPC that completes it, and cancel processing.
//!
//!    Notice the lack of specific lock/unlock operations.
//!
//!    Even though this example utilizes a serial queue, a parallel queue
//!    would not need any additional explicit synchronization, just a
//!    strategy for managing multiple requests outstanding.
